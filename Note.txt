1. SQLite is great for embedded projects, web browsers, and toy projects. Itâ€™s lightweight, but has limited functionality compared to the likes of PostgreSQL or MySQL - two of the more common production SQL technologies.

2. PostgreSQL is more of a monolith, it acts as a server itself. It is a better option when you are storing a massive amount of data in your db. It also has an exhaustive type checking whereas sqlite is loosely typed.

3. What we refer to as a field is a column in sql

4. The act of adding a new field to a db is called a DATABASE MIGRATION

5. Rule of Thumb for Database MIGRATION
-- ADDING A COLUMN OR TABLE --
 a. Update the db(adding new stuff)
 b. Update your code

-- DELETING A COLUNM OR TABLE --
 a. Update the code
 b. Update the db

-- UPDATING A COLUMN OR TABLE --
 a. It is generally a bad idea updating a table/column of a db in production
 b. Get a downtime
 c. Same time deploy(updating the db and code at the same time)
 d. Aliasing(it is the best but it depends on the db)

6. Up migration involves running of the code in order to arrive at the final state while DOWN migration is used to roll back changes in case something goes wrong.

7. SQLITE datatypes -> NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB, BOOLEAN

* The (VARCHAR) is similar to the TEXT, u have to know how long your text field is. It is used in emails, password, hashes

8. Foreign keys are what makes databases relational. It helps relate one data in one table to a data in another table. A way to ensure relationship exist in a db.
